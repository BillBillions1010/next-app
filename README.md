# NOTES
- this app is part of a tutorial series heres the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVnjOPwW4ZA)

> ## Directory Layout
- /app: Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application, this is where you'll be mostly working from.
    - /app/lib: Contains functions used in your application, such as reusable utility functions and data fetching functions.
    - /app/ui: Contains all the UI components for your application, such as cards, tables, and forms. To save time, we've pre-styled these components for you.
- /public: Contains all the static assets for your application, such as images.
- /scripts: Contains a seeding script that you'll use to populate your database in a later chapter.
- Config Files: You'll also notice config files such as next.config.js at the root of your application. Most of these files are created and pre-configured when you start a new project using create-next-app. You will not need to modify them in this course.

Feel free to explore these folders, and don't worry if you don't understand everything the code is doing yet.

## Included by vendor:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
